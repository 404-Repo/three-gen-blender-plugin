# ✍️ Prompts

A prompt is a short text phrase that 404—GEN interprets to create a 3D Gaussian Splat. In this section, we’ll explore how to craft clear and effective prompts, along with tips to refine your input for the best results.

* Describe **a single element** or object, rather than an entire scene. A good rule of thumb is something you can look in toward, rather than out toward, regardless of size. "Sky" wouldn't work, but "planet" would.
* Try to be specific but not overly verbose. Prompts between **2 and 12 words** in length tend to produce the best results.
* You can experiment with keywords for specific styles or materials. A few examples are:
  * Anime
  * Chibi
  * Clay
  * Cute
  * Oil Pastel
  * Papercraft
  * Psychedelic
  * Voxel
