# 🔍 About

404—GEN is a text-to-3D generator that uses a text input to guide 3D Gaussian Splatting, generating a PLY in seconds.

At its core, 404—GEN operates on the decentralized AI network, [Bittensor](https://docs.bittensor.com/), in which participants are rewarded for improving upon open-source SOTA (state-of-the-art) 3D generation models. As a result, the quality of 3D assets created with 404—GEN improves at the same rate as the industry as a whole.

404—GEN is completely free to use via **Discord Bot, Blender Extension,** and **API Integration.**
